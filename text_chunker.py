Text Chunking Module

This module splits large documents into smaller chunks for better processing

TODO:
1. Import necessary libraries (if needed).

2. Create a function to chunk text:
   - Takes text and chunk_size as parameters
   - Takes chunk_overlap as parameter (how much text overlaps between chunks)
   - Split the text into chunks of approximately chunk_size characters
   - Ensure chunks overlap by chunk_overlap characters
   - Return a list of text chunks

3. Implementation approach:
   - You can split by characters, words, or sentences
   - Simple approach: Split by characters with overlap
   - Better approach: Split by sentences, then combine sentences until you reach chunk_size
   - Store each chunk with its metadata (chunk index, source document, etc.)

4. Return format: List of dictionaries or a simple list of strings
   - Each chunk should ideally have: text, chunk_id, source_document

5. Handle edge cases:
   - Very short documents (smaller than chunk_size)
   - Empty documents
